            <p>Recipe from chimes by design blog, accessed on 08 September 2021.
            This recipe makes 5–6 dozen cookies, so prepare yourself for a long day of cookie making! This recipe is great for a bake sale or for a party.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   <ol> <li>1/2 c butter (1 stick)</li>
    <li>2 c brown sugar</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 T vanilla</li>
    <li>1 1/2 c chunky peanut butter</li>
    <li>5 c quick cooking oats</li>
    <li>6 oz plain M&Ms *</li>
    <li>6 oz white chocolate chips*</li>
</ol>
<div class="text2">
<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol> <li> You will need a LARGE bowl. And an army of cookie sheets.
    <li> Preheat the oven to 350°.</li>
    <li>  Cream together butter and sugar.</li>
    <li>   Add peanut butter and beat until somewhat fluffy.</li>
     <li> Combine eggs into mixture.</li>
    <li>Add oats in small portions until they are completely combined.</li>
    <li>To make regular sized cookies, drop by tablespoon onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Or if your dough allows, roll into balls and place on the baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Smash your cookies down with a fork or spoon (these don't flatten out as they bake, but get terrifically chewy!).</li>
    <li> Bake for 12–15 minutes. Depends on your oven and your desired done-ness. I like mine a little crispy, so I go for 15 minutes.</li></ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

<p>* You can mix anything in of your choice here ... possibilities are endless! I usually do M&Ms and dark chocolate chips, but I thought I'd mix it up.</p>
