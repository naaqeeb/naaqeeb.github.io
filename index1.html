<h1>About Me</h1><br>
<h2>Hello there! My name is Naaqeeb and I'm a senior and majoring in Graphic Design. Today I want to share some of my favourite foods from around the world.

    <h2>My Top 5 favourite dishes</h2>
    <h3><li>Butter Chicken</li></h3>
        <p>Butter Chicken is an Indian Dish and its similar to Tikka Masala. Butter Chicken is made with buttery curry with some cream which give smooth and rich texture.</p>
    <h3><li>Momos</li></h3>
    <p>Orginated from Nepal, Momo is a type of steamed dumplings with filing. There are different varieties of momos and my favorite ones are one with the chicken.</p>
    <h3><li>Yaki Udon</li></h3>
    <p>Yaki Udon is a Japanese stir-fried noodles, made with vegetables and meat. </p>
    <h3><li>Hamburgers and Fries</li></h3>
    <p>Classic Meal. Even though there's plenty of fast food chains which serves hamburgers but nothing beats freshly home-made burgers and fries.</p>
    <h3><li>Shawarma</li></h3>
    <p>Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish, made with some fresh garlic sauce and chicken meat served on pita. I like to add some tahini(sesame seeds paste) sauce in my pita wrap. </p><br>

    <h2>Top 5 favorite Desserts</h2>
    <h3><li>Key Lime Pie</li></h3>
    <p>Key lime pie is a creamy-citrius-y-tarty pie made with graham cracker crust with some filings and toppings. I love some key lime pies after a heavy lunch! </p>
    <h3><li>Basbousa</li></h3>
    <p>Originated from Egypt, Basbousa is made out of semolina and syrup.</p>   
    <h3><li>Creme Brulee</li></h3>
    <p>My favourite luxury dessert from France. Made with egg based cream and caramel on top. </p>
    <h3><li>Tiramisu</li></h3>
    <p> Tiramisu is a Italian dessert. Its made with layer of sponge cakes, soaked in coffee, topped with mascarpone cheese and powdered chocolate.</p>
    <h3><li>Mochi</li></h3>
    <p>Mochi or Mochi cake is a Japanese dessert which is made out of steamed rice which is then pounded and shaped into mochi balls. Strawberry Mochis are my favorite. </p>
